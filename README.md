#### I am trying to create a firebase based Ecommerce Site.

## Feature List:

- [x] Login/Signup Functionality
- [x] Login Check
- [x] Add to Cart
- [x] View Cart
- [x] Store Cart Items in Database
- [x] Cart Total Display
- [ ] Multiple Instances of Same Product
- [ ] Product Searching
- [ ] Account Management and My Orders
- [ ] Checkout Functionality


<strong>This site is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) and is Powered by [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com).</strong>

Try the demo out : https://luciferreeves.github.io/firebase-ecommerce/

### Notes: 

- All products shown on this site are non-existent and would not be shipped. The products are shown only for demonstration purposes.
- Payments of the products are not processed.
- There is a great lack of styling on the site because I do not intend to create a "beautiful" ecommerce solution but a "functional" ecommerce solution (though I am soon gonna add styles and features).

## Cloning:
