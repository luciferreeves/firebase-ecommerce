Trying to create an ecommerce website using firebase


This site is hosted on github pages

Try the demo out : https://luciferreeves.github.io/firebase-ecommerce/

This site showcases the use of Google Firebase : https://firebase.google.com

All products shown on this site are non-existent and would not be shipped. The products are shown only for demonstration purposes.

Payments of the products are not processed.

There is a great lack of styling on the site because I do not intend to create a "beautiful" ecommerce solution but a "functional" ecommerce solution.

Clone this repository and make your own changes if necessary.

To clone:

````
git clone https://github.com/luciferreeves/firebase-ecommerce.git
````
